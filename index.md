In just over a week \#citymash will be underway and so far we have had some excellent new speakers confirmed.  On the day we also hope some of our participants will be inspired enough to pitch their own sessions too.

There are still spaces available if you wish to attend the event.  If you'd like to register, please do so by going to our [Eventbrite page](http://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/citymash-libraries-and-technology-unconference-tickets-16584911918).  Registration is free.

In the meantime, you can view our list of [speakers](http://citymash.github.io/speakers/) and skeleton programme on [this site](http://citymash.github.io/programme/).  Please note that times will be flexible due to the unconference structure.

See you soon!
