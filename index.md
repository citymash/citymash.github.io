## "\#citymash - call for session leaders"

Libraries in the 21st century are increasingly technology-driven, from coding to blogging, from digitisation projects to Twitter outreach.  The rapidness with which these technologies are permeating the GLAM sector can sometimes be daunting and challenging for librarians and info practitioners at all levels and at all stages of their careers.

\#citymash - part of the [Mashed Library](http://www.mashedlibrary.com/) series of events - aims to bring together librarians and other information professionals in sharing their expertise and knowledge of using tech in a library environment.

The event will be centred around some planned workshops and sessions, as well as an unconference stream where participants can feel free to take the stage and discuss their own ideas and expertise.  The aim is to provide a supportive atmosphere wherein both tech experts and novices alike can work together to break down barriers and assumptions about tech in libraries being an insurmountable challenge.  

We hope to foster a lasting spirit of collaboration between professionals in the field, and, more importantly, to prove that using technology in libraries doesn’t have to be scary – and can even be fun.

To that end, we would like to put out a call for session leaders who share this ideal and would like to help their fellow librarians feel more comfortable using technology.  Any experience you’ve encountered in your professional role would be invaluable to us and your peers.  If you’d like to volunteer and register your interest in leading a session for \#citymash, please contact [Sarah Stewart](sastewart@live.co.uk) citing your expertise and/or your ideas for pitching a session.
